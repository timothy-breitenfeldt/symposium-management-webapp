## 3.0 Known Bugs

### 3.1 User Known Bugs


### 3.2 Admin Known Bugs
* When a admin deletes an event, the event won't be deleted if a user has already added the event to their user schedule.
* When an admin deletes a conference, it won't be deleted if a user has already registered for the conference and has events for that conference on their user schedule.
Note that just unregistering all users from a conference is not enough, all events must be removed from user schedules to successfully delete a conference.
